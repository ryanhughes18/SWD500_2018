# SWD_500 Course Schedule 

Welcome to SWD_500 please find below the course schedule. The two practical sessions are currently on a Thursday. **Don't forget to create a git repository that will hold you practical work** . You should just have one repo which will contain all of the practical sessions. You should consider adding a creative commons licence to this repo (can be done automatically GITHUB on set up). Also, create a compelling `README.md`.
