# SWD_500 Course Schedule 

Welcome to SWD_500, please find below the course schedule. The two practical sessions are currently on a Thursday. 

## Before you start any of the practical ensure you create a public github repository 

**Don't forget to create a Git/GitHUB repository that will hold your practical work this class** . You should just have one repo to contain all of the practical sessions. You should consider adding a creative commons licence to this repo (can be done automatically GITHUB on set up). Also, create a compelling `README.md` consider including pictures in and make it appealing to prospective employers.
