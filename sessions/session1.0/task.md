# Session 1 Practical - HTML/CSS Revision


Create a simple home page on a topic of your choice.

Please go wild and style the page as much as you like, but as a minimum I want to see you complete the below tasks. Once done your page should resemble the layout below:

![site_layout](assets/website_layout)


* Section up your site using a minimum of 3 `<div>'s `#left_nav`, `#section` and `#wrapper` which holds all the content.
* To start with give `#left_nav` a width of **20%** and `#section` a width of **80%**.
* Give `#wrapper` a width of **80%** and centre align it using `#wrapper {margin: 0 auto;}` 
* Add a different `background-color` to  `#left_nav` and `#section`.
* Use `float` to position  `#left_nav` and `#section` side by side, as per the mock up above. 
* Use a `<ul>...</ul>` to create a basic navigation list in `#left_nav`. Have at least 3 links, but you don't need to create the corresponding pages. Here's how to create a placeholder link: `<a href="#">  Home </a>`
* Apply some pseudo classes to your links, so they change colour based on their status. Below is an example: 

		         a:link {color:#FF0000;}      /* unvisited link */   
			 a:visited {color:#00FF00;}   /* visited link */   
			 a:hover {color:#FF00FF;}     /* mouse over link */   
   		         a:active {color:#0000FF;}    /* selected link */  
   		    
* Insert an image into the main section and centre align it
* Remove the bullet points from the `<ul>` nav list **(Optional)** 
* Create two further side by side sections in the main #section
