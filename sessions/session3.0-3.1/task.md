#Task - Create your own grid 

This week we are going to create our own grid.  We will focus on making it responsive in the next session. 

**Note,** you should document your choices as you will need to reflect on them when it comes to writing up your work. 

**I suggest you use code pen to create your grid, you'll then be able to link to it for your assessment**

**1)** Decide on the number of columns you want your grid to have, **12** is a common choice. However, you should research and find out which col count meets your need. 

**2)** Work out the width of a single column, **100% /number of columns**. When you know the width of a single column, you can the work out the width of further columns, for example a 3 column width will be **single column width * 3**


**3)** Go through the process outlined in the notes to create your grid


**4)**  Export your grid from codepen, by clicking `Export->export.zip`

**5)** Using your grid create a experimental page.
