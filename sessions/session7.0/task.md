# Create a responsive grid using sass 

- You should consider this the starting point for your assessment2
- Take an existing grid that you've perhaps made in css and enhance it using sass. [If you don't have a grid feel free to use mine](https://codepen.io/joeappleton18/pen/VKqdbX)

- You should consider the following 

- Setting up variables for properties such as `number_of_cols`, `max_width`, `gutter`
	
 - Use a loop to auto generate offsets and columns
