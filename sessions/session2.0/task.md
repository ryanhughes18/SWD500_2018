# GitHub team Collaboration 

The goal of this task is to collaborate to create a website on a topic that interest. 

1. Split up into teams of 3 or 4 
2. Make sure you all set your user name on your local version of git. From command line type `git config --global user.name "your name"`
2. Decide on what type of website you want to create. 
3. Delegate work, each team member should be responsible for a specific part of the website. 
4. One member of the team should set up a repository. You should then follow the steps in the [notes](README.md) in order to collaborate and create the website. 
5. When you're finished publish the work for free to the world using [gitHubPages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/)



# Some helpful quick git commands

Below are some useful commands that I use all the time:


### Help! I've badly messed up since the last commit 

`git reset --hard`   

Resets your work to the last commit 

### I've committed but now made a small change that should have been part of the last commit

`git add -A`  
`git commit --amend` 

Adds any files to the old commit 
 
### Help! my local version is out of sync with the remote

If this happens are you are working on your own project. Simply forcefully override your GitHub repo with your local version.

`git push origin <branch-name>  --force`
