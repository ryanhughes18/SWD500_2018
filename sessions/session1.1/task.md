**You should ensure you use the following techniques:**


- The the main content should be in a wrapper `div` set to a width of 980px and alined to the centre 
- Add a white to grey gradient to the wrapper, work out how make the gradient resemble the mock up above 
- Add a drop shadow to the photo 
- You should use the following HTML5 tags `<section>` , `<aside>`, `<header>`
- The page should be responsive, consider what the mobile version would look like first!
