 2) Visit the following url [https://github.com/joeappleton18/SWD500TemplateingPractical](https://github.com/joeappleton18/SWD500TemplateingPractical) and click the fork button. Forking copies the repository over to your github account     
 3) Next, clone your repository to your local computer    
 4) Transfer the website over to your 12 col grid that you created in the last session 
 5) Using media queries make a mobile version of the website, remember to take a mobile first approach when designing the new version of the website
